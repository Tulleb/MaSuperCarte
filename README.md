## Comments
The app now ask for an address to point it out on the center of the map.
An auto-completion is proposed when typing, going up to 3 propositions in a table view below the search bar.

I tried to add some more unit tests. It took me some time to read on the internet how to deal with async functions in XCTestCase. I didn't want to spend more time on it as I am already late on the schedule.
