## Comments
Sorry, this step isn't finished and doesn't compile. I also set the 2 last steps (6 & 7) to the 4th step commit.

I already overpassed the 8h I had scheduled, without even counting the time I have spent on tutorials and videos about MVVM and FRP (basically the whole weekend).
It would take me days to apply the concept for this step. And maybe it would even be better to start from scratch actually. For more details, I have been struggling with the MapView which should basically become a simple view, and which should be redefined in what I called "MapboxViewModel". But I guess I was not going in the good direction knowing that there shouldn't be any kind of view controller in a ViewModel... I should also have separated the Location Manager and the Geocoder in other classes as well.

Also, I'm sure I could have tried it differently to do the job: making some hacks with circles dependencies and delegates, but I am quite sure it was not what you are expecting here.

As I told to Jerome, I am a beginner in MVVM and Reactive programming. I already have learned more about it in a weekend than I ever did before. The concept looks really promising and easy to maintain afterwards. I am sure that apps which offer this architecture are way more stable and easy to work with, also regarding the new kind of tests it can offer.

I have still a lot to learn about this, I know. It is not easy to understand and apply the whole concept, on my own, in just a few days.
