## Comments
The app start by prompting the user to share his/her location.
If the user denies, the app keeps working instead of stopping to be in compliance with the App Store Guidelines.
If the user accepts, then the map is centered to his/her location, and a short animation starts to zoom in.

I have added 2 unit tests. I know they might already have a lot more, or that I could have write them in a better way, but as I said to Jérôme this is the first time I am creating some through a XCTestCase in Swift.
